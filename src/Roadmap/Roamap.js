                  The 777 Club lifestyle is fast-paced and actively seeks the
                  best things in life. The first stage of our club is
                  establishing a strong community based on the Clubhouse
                  Founders Collection of 777 member passes. It’s how we live,
                  and we want to share it with you. Throughout late Q1, we will
                  be focused on building our community and personally connecting
                  with our followers, collaborating with other NFT projects, and
                  creating meaningful partnerships.

                  In early Q2, we will mint! We will sell the Clubhouse
                  Collection to our founding members, who will reap extra
                  rewards. Soon after, we will launch the concierge service,
                  including a social networking aspect, and deliver our 777
                  Clubhouse welcome packages to your door. We will sell the
                  Clubhouse Collection to our founding members, who will reap
                  extra rewards.

                  In April, we will purchase a plot of prime meta-estate to
                  launch our metaverse social club. A spot where NFT holders can
                  meet, display their NFT collections, and help monetize the
                  space for more rewards.

                  We will begin a merch collab with a top-tier design label in
                  May while distributing the 777 Club Friends Airdrop. This will
                  take us to our next in-person event, to be announced shortly
                  after the sale.

                  In Q3, we are headed to Mykonos because that’s what one does
                  in the summer. That will be followed by the casual stop in
                  Ibiza before wrapping things up for the fall/winter schedule.
                  Get ready for some exciting events + member meet-ups across
                  Europe this summer.
